# ComplaintBox dApp ðŸš€

## Project Description  
ComplaintBox is a simple decentralized application (dApp) built on the Algorand blockchain.  
The idea is to provide a transparent and tamper-proof way for users to submit complaints or feedback without fear of them being altered or deleted.  

This project was created as a beginner-friendly introduction to writing Algorand smart contracts in TypeScript and deploying them on-chain.
